# Summary

## General way to approach any NR problem
- Start with the choice of free data or data you want to reproduce i.e. $\tilde{\gamma}_{ij}$, $\hat{A}_{ij}$, $K$, $\tilde{E}$ and $\tilde{P}^i$. 

- Now, we look for deeper insights because of all the choice. Like what does it tell us about the conformal covariant derivate, Ricci scalar adn conformal killing operator $(\tilde{L})$ and many more (if necessary).

- Then, I formulate my contraint equations as well as evolution equations. 

- In order to solve these equations, I need to setup a very important thing i.e. the boundary/initial value problem for my corresponding equation. 
 Moreover, specifying the inner and outer boundary condition is also one of the fundamental aspect which is necessary. 

- It is also necessary for me to look out for the type of equation I have, i.e. it could be parabolic, hyperbolic and elliptic. 
 Now, one problem that this poses is whether they are computationally solvable or not. We have to keep that in mind too.

## Overall Remarks 

- One of the interesting thing in context of NR is the problem of *well-posedness* and *unqiueness*. 
- Rigourously study the computational methods to solve *hyperbolic*, *parabolic* and *elliptic* equations.
